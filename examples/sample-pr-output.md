```terraform
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

## What This Shows

This PR comment demonstrates:

1. **All validation checks passed** - Format, validation, linting all successful
2. **Clear change summary** - 2 resources to create, 0 to update, 0 to destroy
3. **Full plan details** - Reviewers can expand to see exactly what will change
4. **Automated posting** - No manual copy/paste required
5. **Audit trail** - Shows who triggered the workflow and what event

## Reviewer Actions

After seeing this comment, a reviewer would:

1. ✅ **Review the change summary** - Understand the scope (2 creates, 0 changes, 0 destroys)
2. ✅ **Expand full plan** - Verify the security group rules, instance configuration, tags
3. ✅ **Check for security issues** - Note the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR (acceptable for demo, restrict in production)
4. ✅ **Approve or request changes** - Based on the plan details
5. ✅ **Merge when ready** - Triggers the apply workflow with manual approval gate

## Real-World Variations

In production, you might see:

- **🔄 Updates** - Existing resources being modified (instance type change, tag updates)
- **❌ Destroys** - Resources being removed (would trigger warnings in PR comment)
- **⚠️ Replaces** - Resources requiring recreation (would be highlighted with warnings)
- **Format failures** - If code isn't formatted, the workflow would post the failure and block merge
- **Validation errors** - Syntax errors or missing required arguments would be shown inline

## Why This Matters

Automated PR comments:
- Save time (no manual plan sharing)
- Create audit trail (plan is preserved in PR history)
- Enable asynchronous review (reviewers can review when ready)
- Improve quality (all changes reviewed before merge)
- Reduce errors (what's reviewed is what gets applied via artifacts)
